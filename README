======================================== Description ===================================


The purpose of this app is schedule the best brazilian soccer team of ever and maybe do it with another 
selections and share this on social networks, but this still a prototypo without all the best players added, 
it's not able to share on facebook, and the layout is not finished.
This app was done with play framework 2.2.3, java and use the native database h2
The photos used must be changed for the final version and sometimes the application doesn't work well on firefox.

Using a simple CRUD to make connection with the h2 database
The "create form" add another 'jogador' (player) to the database, and it becomes one of the options available 
to put in one of the positions of the field.
The "edit form" allows change the player in each position (and it changes the photo) 
The "delete form" delete one of the positions avaible in the field

To change the player of the position you must click on the photo with the brazilian escudo over the field
that you want to change, and will be open the form to do it.
To add a player you must click on the button on the right side of the field and add the name of the player
